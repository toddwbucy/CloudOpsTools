  "task_description": "# Rate Limiting Implementation\n\nImplement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure service stability. Include configurable limits per endpoint category with graceful degradation and informative error responses.\n\n## Rationale\nCritical for production security and stability. Currently identified as technical debt. Prevents DoS attacks and ensures fair resource usage across concurrent users.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a system administrator, I want rate limiting in place so that the service remains stable during high load periods\n- As a security engineer, I want API rate limits so that the platform is protected from abuse\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Rate limits configurable via environment variables or config file\n- [ ] Returns 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header when limit exceeded\n- [ ] Different rate limits for different endpoint categories (auth, execution, read)\n- [ ] Rate limit metrics exposed in health endpoint\n- [ ] Graceful handling that doesn't crash the application\n",
